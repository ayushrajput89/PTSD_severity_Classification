(High severity)

The loud, piercing alarm blared without warning, instantly triggering an overwhelming physical response. Their entire body seized up, and they immediately dropped what they were holding as a flood of disorientation washed over them. Their breathing became shallow and rapid, and they felt a desperate need to find immediate cover, the external noise completely drowning out their ability to think clearly or rationally respond to the actual situation.


(Low severity)

The flashing blue and red lights outside the window immediately drew his attention, causing him to pause mid-sentence. His heart began to pound a little harder, a dull, familiar thud against his ribs, and he felt a tension tighten across his shoulders and neck. While he didn't panic, a heavy layer of vigilance settled over his thoughts, making it difficult to fully concentrate on the conversation. He waited, restless and watchful, until the siren faded completely into the distance, before he was able to push the intrusive feeling aside and fully return to the moment.

I’ve been feeling a bit stressed lately because of work and daily responsibilities, but overall I’m managing fine. I don’t feel afraid or unsafe, and I’m able to sleep normally. I mostly want to improve my routine and reduce general stress.

(Moderate  severity)
I avoid the entire neighborhood where it happened. If I hear anything loud — even a car backfiring — my heart pounds and I feel like I’m choking. Sometimes I freeze completely. It’s like my body thinks I’m in danger even when I’m not.

Some memories from the past still bother me occasionally. Loud noises make me uncomfortable, and sometimes I feel anxious without a clear reason. I wouldn’t say it’s overwhelming, but it does affect my mood and concentration at times.
